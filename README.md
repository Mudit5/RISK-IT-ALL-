# CASE STUDY OF THE PROJECT

Many students find it difficult to learn scientific, general knowledge facts and solving mathematical questions. These topics are very important in student’s life as they facilitate their academic success.
Poor knowledge of these topics lead to their poor grade in exams. As we all know that today’s students are quite familiar with technology and love to play games. So this could be the perfect pathway to improve their aptitude for different topics, thus improving their grades.
Playing games increases enthusiasm in students and promotes healthy competitive spirit. Thus it would be encouraging if we give them a chance to show off their ability to think and test their knowledge. They may get to learn some new things, which would surely help them in their studies.
Implementing the same, this project has been made keeping well in mind the inconveniences one faces and modeling the real world closely.
